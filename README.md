# Water Pollution & Disease Prediction

## Overview
Access to clean and safe water is a critical public health concern in Kenya and many parts of the world. Contaminated water sources contribute to waterborne diseases such as **cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea**.  
This project applies **machine learning techniques** to predict the risk of waterborne diseases based on water pollution indicators, enabling early interventions and informed public health decision-making.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to **predict the occurrence or risk of waterborne diseases** using pollution measurements.  
By identifying high-risk areas early, stakeholders can:
- Allocate resources more efficiently  
- Implement targeted interventions  
- Reduce disease incidence rates

##  Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle — Water Pollution & Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/water-pollution-and-disease)  
- **Size:** ~3,000 rows  
- **Features:** 24 variables (chemical, physical, and microbial water indicators)  
- **Target:**  
  - *Classification*: Presence/absence of disease  
  - *Regression*: Incidence rate of disease  

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical features  
   - Normalize/scale numerical features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of features & target variable  
   - Correlations between pollution indicators and disease  
   - Visualizations for insights  

3. **Modeling**
   - Baseline models: Logistic Regression / Linear Regression  
   - Advanced models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost  

4. **Evaluation**
   - *Classification:* Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC  
   - *Regression:* RMSE, MAE, R²  

5. **Interpretation**
   - Feature importance analysis  
   - SHAP values or permutation importance for explainability

##  Expected Impact
- Early detection of high-risk areas for waterborne diseases  
- Enhanced **public health monitoring** and timely response  
- Insights into **key pollution factors** driving disease prevalence
